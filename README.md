Update is used for writing

Value is used for reading

HTML is for assets

Val is the same as Value

Using = in playerCountRef.on("value",function(data) will be reading

Using : in Json would be writing. (This needs and arguement)

Set has more power than Update

Static Function is not attached to an object; Directly called using class

(data)=> is another way to writing function(data)

++ is another way to say var=var+1

On is a listener

Once is a listener like on, but only listens once

Async will cause the machine reading to wait.

Await will cause the machine to wait a value at a certain point.

An array is updated 

var=loadFont()
textFont()
